Wastewater Recycling and Reuse by Kunnankalpalayam Common Effluent Treatment Plant Pvt Ltd 

UWR RoU Scope: Scope 5: Conservation measures taken to 
recycle and/or reuse water, spent wash, 
wastewater etc. across or within specific 
industrial processes and systems, including 
wastewater recycled/ reused in a different 
process, but within the same site or location 
of the project activity. Recycled wastewater 
used in off-site landscaping, gardening or tree 
plantations/forests activity are also eligible 
under this Scope.

Effluent and Water Recovery Management: The CETP handled an average inflow of 2497 m³/day, 50% 
of the design capacity. Recovered water for member units varied between 86% and 95% of the effluent 
flow, improving water reuse efficiency. 
These interventions collectively enhanced the CETP’s capacity, optimized water recovery, and ensured 
efficient brine management, leading to improved operational performance and environmental 
sustainability. 

The project activity hence achieves the sustainable management and efficient use of India’s natural 
resources since the PP had the option to install bore wells that would have depleted the local 
groundwater resources and/or continued to use existing drinking water resources in the surrounding 
area. The PP has instead intervened and chosen to treat and reuse ETP effluent voluntarily at significant 
costs, thus saving millions of liters of safe drinking water for the city. 

Increase in population density and improvement in quality of life has resulted in an increase in demand 
for natural resources like water. Groundwater being the major source of water supply catering to about 
85% of rural water supply, the stress on groundwater is ever increasing. It has resulted in overexploitation of the resources at places. The situation demands a reorientation of the strategy for its 
development and management. 
The intervention of the PP has had a direct impact on the water security of the area. Over-development 
of the ground water resources results in declining ground water levels, shortage in water supply, 
intrusion of saline water in coastal areas and increased pumping lifts necessitating deepening of ground 
water structures and increase in power costs. 

This project activity involves treating and reusing wastewater. It doesn’t include any land-use practices. 
Also, this is an industrial process designed with technical requirements and following the specified 
norms of the local pollution control board. Hence, the project activity does not harm any land and 
Drainage system.

The Kunnankalpalayam CETP is designed to handle effluent from textile dyeing industries, specifically 
processing 5.5 million Liters per Day (MLD) of highly colored wastewater containing various dyes and 
chemicals. The treatment process begins when colored effluent from multiple dyeing units is collected in 
a centralized Receiving Sump. This initial collection point serves as the heart of the primary treatment 
phase, ensuring consistent feed to the subsequent treatment processes. 

Primary Treatment and Equalization: 
From the Receiving Sump, the effluent passes through a Bar Screen system, which effectively removes 
larger solid materials like fabric pieces and debris that could potentially damage downstream 
equipment. The screened wastewater then flows into a Storage & Homogeneous Tank, where it's 
thoroughly mixed to ensure uniform composition. This equalization step is crucial as it helps manage 
varying flow rates and concentrations from different industrial units. Following this, the wastewater 
enters a Neutralization Tank where its pH is carefully adjusted to create optimal conditions for biological 
treatment. 

Biological Treatment and Clarification: 
The neutralized effluent undergoes biological treatment in an aeration tank, where microorganisms 
break down organic compounds in the presence of oxygen. This biological process is fundamental in 
reducing the organic load of wastewater. The treated mixture then flows into a Secondary Clarifier, 
where gravity separation allows the treated water to be separated from the biological sludge. The 
settled sludge is collected in a Sludge Return Sump for further processing, while the clarified water 
moves to a Chlorine Contact Tank for disinfection. 

Advanced Filtration System: 
After chlorination, the water undergoes a series of sophisticated filtration steps. It first passes through a 
Quartz Filter for removal of suspended particles, followed by Micro Filtration for finer particulate

removal, and finally through a Softener Filter to reduce water hardness. This multi-stage filtration 
ensures the water quality meets the stringent requirements for further advanced treatment. The filtered 
water then enters a Reactor Clarifier for additional purification and preparation for the reverse osmosis 
process. 

Reverse Osmosis and Concentrate Management: 
The treatment system incorporates a multi-stage Reverse Osmosis (RO) process, including primary RO 
followed by Additional Stage RO (4th & 5th Stage HPRO). This advanced separation technology produces 
high-quality permeate (treated water) while concentrating the dissolved solids in the reject stream. The 
RO reject, rich in dissolved salts, is further processed through a Multiple Effect Evaporator (MEE) system, 
where it's concentrated through careful evaporation under vacuum conditions. The condensate from 
the MEE is recycled back into the system, while the concentrate moves to an Agitated Thin Film Dryer 
(ATFD) for final processing. The R.O. permeate generating from the R.O. system is sent to the member 
dyeing industries for reuse in the dyeing process. The reject from the R.O system is further concentrated 
in the Addl. Stage R.O. & High pressure R.O. systems to get the reject TDS of 90 g/L. to 100 g/L. 

Resource Recovery and Product Generation: 
The ATFD process is crucial in recovering valuable products from the concentrated stream. It produces 
several commercially valuable products including Glauber's Salt, Anhydrous Sodium Sulphate, and

Sodium Chloride Salt. Meanwhile, the treated water stream is collected in a Product Water Storage 
Tank. A separate stream of treated brine is also produced through a dedicated brine preparation system. 
The facility demonstrates excellent resource recovery principles, with all products being reused by 
member industrial units. 

Sludge Management and Environmental Compliance: 
The treatment process generates two types of sludge - biological and chemical. These are efficiently 
managed through Filter Press operations, which dewater the sludge to produce manageable solid cake. 
The biological sludge can be used as bio-fertilizer, while chemical sludge is properly disposed of 
following environmental regulations. The filtrate from the press operations is recycled back into the 
treatment system, ensuring maximum water recovery. 
This comprehensive treatment system represents a modern Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) facility that not 
only treats industrial effluent to meet environmental standards but also recovers valuable resources. 
The process demonstrates how industrial wastewater can be effectively treated while recovering useful 
products and minimizing environmental impact. The success of this facility lies in its systematic approach 
to treatment, efficient resource recovery, and commitment to environmental sustainability. 
Through this integrated approach, the Kunnankalpalayam CETP effectively manages industrial effluent 
while recovering valuable resources, making it a model for sustainable industrial wastewater treatment. 
The facility's design ensures that water quality standards are met while maximizing the recovery and 
reuse of valuable materials, contributing to both environmental protection and resource conservation.
